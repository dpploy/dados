[Cortix](https://cortix.org) module for data acquisition of various sensors (in development). The goal of this module is to provide a common interface for real-time data acquisition so other Cortix modules can use the data for various modeling and simulation 
purposes including: automated reporting, mobile data visualization, remote and distributed process control, alert systems, etc.
